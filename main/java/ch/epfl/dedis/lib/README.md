# dedis-java-library

These are a couple of libraries that are to be used with different java-
implementations. They will probably migrate sooner or later to
github.com/dedis/cothority.

## ServerIdentity

The node-definition for a node in a cothority. It contains the IP-address
and a description.

## Roster

A list of ServerIdentities make up a roster that can be used as a temporary
cothority.

## UUIDType5

I couldn't find a uuid-type5 library, so I copied this one from the web.
